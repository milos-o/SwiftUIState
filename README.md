# SwiftUIState

This repo contains logic from [Swift Talk](https://www.objc.io) particular course regarding recreating the way how SwiftUI creates it's body and state management properties like @State, @Binding, @ObservedObject.

Quote from the creators themselves: "We reimplement parts of SwiftUI's state system to better understand how SwiftUI manages state and which views get executed when."
